                <div class="faq_answer">Things to take into cosideration when your friend is going through one of their episodes is to remind the person that they are having a panic attack and they are not obligated to stay where they are. Make sure to constantly reassure them that there is nothing to be afraid of and that the episode is only temporary. Breathing is key to overcoming an attack. And lastly, try to engage them in conversation, casually bring topics up to get their mind off of a attack, staying with someone through their attack will greatly help your friend and let them know that they aren't alone. <p><br></p></div>
