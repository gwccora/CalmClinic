          10 Minute Walk: A nice walk will help to clear your head and boost endorphins which will then reduce stress hormones. When taking your walk you should keep in mind that by walking in a park or green space can put your body into a state of meditation. You can thank the phenomenon known as “involuntary attention”. This occurs during which something holds our attention, but simultaneously allows for reflection.

          Buy Yourself a Plant: Plants can help you calm down. Researchers have found that simply being around plants can induce your relaxation response. One Washington State University study found that a group of stressed-out people who entered a room full of plants had a four-point drop in their blood pressure, while a comparison group who didn’t see plants dropped only two points. When it comes to finding those perfect plants to help calm you down, aloe plants, english ivys, and rubber trees are the way to go.

While shallow breathing — a marker of stress — stimulates the sympathetic nervous system, reported NPR, deep breathing does the opposite: It stimulates the parasympathetic reaction, which helps us to calm down
