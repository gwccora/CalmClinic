    <em><p><b>Information:</b>
    <em> What are the different types of depression?
      Signs and Symptoms

      If you have been experiencing some of the following signs and symptoms most of the day, nearly every day, for at least two weeks, you may be suffering from depression:

      Persistent sad, anxious, or empty mood
      Feelings of hopelessness, or pessimism
      Irritability
      Feelings of guilt, worthlessness, or helplessness
      Loss of interest or pleasure in hobbies and activities
      Decreased energy or fatigue
      Moving or talking more slowly
      Feeling restless or having trouble sitting still
      Difficulty concentrating, remembering, or making decisions
      Difficulty sleeping, early-morning awakening, or oversleeping
      Appetite and/or weight changes
      Thoughts of death or suicide, or suicide attempts
      Aches or pains, headaches, cramps, or digestive problems without a clear physical cause and/or that do not ease even with treatment
      Not everyone who is depressed experiences every symptom. Some people experience only a few symptoms while others may experience many. Several persistent symptoms in addition to low mood are required for a diagnosis of major depression, but people with only a few but distressing symptoms may benefit from treatment of their subsyndromal depression. The severity and frequency of symptoms and how long they last will vary depending on the individual and his or her particular illness. Symptoms may also vary depending on the stage of the illness.

      <em><p><b>Goals:</b> These tips can help you feel better -- starting right now.

<br> </em>1. Get in a routine. If you're depressed, you need a routine, says Ian Cook, MD. He's a psychiatrist and director of the Depression Research and Clinic Program at UCLA.

Depression can strip away the structure from your life. One day melts into the next. Setting a gentle daily schedule can help you get back on track.

<br> </em>2.Set goals. When you're depressed, you may feel like you can't accomplish anything. That makes you feel worse about yourself. To push back, set daily goals for yourself.

"Start very small," Cook says. "Make your goal something that you can succeed at, like doing the dishes every other day."

As you start to feel better, you can add more challenging daily goals.

<br> </em>3. Exercise. It temporarily boosts feel-good chemicals called endorphins. It may also have long-term benefits for people with depression. Regular exercise seems to encourage the brain to rewire itself in positive ways, Cook says.

How much exercise do you need? You donâ€™t need to run marathons to get a benefit. Just walking a few times a week can help.

<br> </em>4. Eat healthy. There is no magic diet that fixes depression. It's a good idea to watch what you eat, though. If depression tends to make you overeat, getting in control of your eating will help you feel better.

Although nothing is definitive, Cook says there's evidence that foods with omega-3 fatty acids (such as salmon and tuna) and folic acid (such as spinach and avocado) could help ease depression.
<br> </em>5. Get enough sleep. Depression can make it hard to get enough shut-eye, and too little sleep can make depression worse.

<br> </em>What can you do? Start by making some changes to your lifestyle. Go to bed and get up at the same time every day. Try not to nap. Take all the distractions out of your bedroom -- no computer and no TV. In time, you may find your sleep improves.<br></p> </em>

      <em> </em></p><p><em><b>SUCCESS STORIES:</b><br> <br> </em>Jon Hamm

Hamm is best known for his work as Mad Men leading lothario Don Draper, a dark character who battles many demons on the hit TV show. In his own life, Hamm suffered the loss of his mother at age 10 and his father at age 20, and he admitted to Observer magazine that he has struggled with chronic depression. To cope with the loss of his parents, Hamm dedicated himself to school and work. He pulled through his depression with the help of antidepressants and therapy sessions, as well as support from his friends and their parents.

<br> </em>Gwyneth Paltrow:

This Oscar winning actress opened up in an interview with Good Housekeeping magazine about her struggles with postpartum depression. Paltrow didn't initially recognize that her symptoms were related to depression, but her then-husband, Coldplay frontman Chris Martin, did. Paltrow says she felt emotionally disconnected and like a 'zombie' after the birth of her son. Acknowledging her depression symptoms was the first step to getting help, she says, and therapy and regular exercise helped her recover after that.
<br> </em> Brad Pitt:
He's one of the biggest names in Hollywood. But despite his success, Pitt has dealt with depression. Pitt told the Hollywood Reporter that toward the end of the 1990s, he slipped into a deep depression. He decided to turn his life around after a trip to Morocco and Yugoslavia, where he witnessed extreme poverty. Becoming involved in humanitarian organizations helped him overcome depression by focusing on helping those in need.

<br> </em>Brooke Shields:

There was one role that the famous model-turned-actress truly desired in her life: mom. So when Shields finally had her daughter in 2003 after struggling to have a baby, she couldn't understand the extreme sadness and rage that washed over her and kept her from bonding with her baby. She shared on The Oprah Winfrey Show about being diagnosed with severe postpartum depression and, although at first resistant, agreeing to take the antidepressants prescribed by her doctor and attending weekly therapy sessions. She wrote a book about her struggles, Down Came the Rain: My Journey Through Postpartum Depression, which has been an inspiration to many.

<br> </em>Rosie O'Donnell:

The comedienne and talk show host may be known for getting big laughs, but she hasn't always felt so joyful inside. She acknowledged on the daytime talkfest The View that after the Columbine High School shootings in 1999, she sank into a depression that caused her to cry constantly and be unable to get out of bed. O'Donnell credits medications for helping her tackle her depression symptoms. While she still struggles with seasonal affective disorder, she continues to manage her depression using inversion therapy, a practice that involves hanging upside down.

<br> </em>J.K. Rowling:

Today, Rowling is the well-known author of the best selling Harry Potter series. But before Rowling started writing, she suffered from major depression. She told the British newspaper The Sunday Times that as a newly divorced mom in her twenties with an infant daughter, she was constantly afraid that her baby would die. She also started having suicidal thoughts.

Her regular doctor was away when Rowling sought help, and the doctor she saw brushed off her concerns. When her doctor returned and read through Rowling's file, she called her in right away and recommended cognitive behavioral therapy, which proved successful in helping Rowling manage her depression symptoms. </br> </em>
