            <h1>What is this website?</h1>
            <p>This is a website that focuses on helping people through mental attacks. This website can also be used by anyone to help them calm down or help relieve stress. We hope this website will be helping people through their episodes and helping them come to terms with their attack while letting them know how to act in the future.</p>
          </div>
          <div id="why">
            <h1>Why did we create this website?</h1>
            <p>We created this website with the goal to help people through their attacks. This website is not only to support people who go through their episodes but people who are affected by the episodes. We want people to feel useful rather than unhelpful if someone they know is going through an attack. Knowing when someone is having an attack and how to help them will be beneficial to both parties. </p>
